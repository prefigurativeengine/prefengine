# If you enable Transport, your system will route traffic
# for other peers, pass announces and serve path requests.
# This should be done for systems that are suited to act
# as transport nodes, ie. if they are stationary and
# always-on. This directive is optional and can be removed
# for brevity.

# By default, the first program to launch the Reticulum
# Network Stack will create a shared instance, that other
# programs can communicate with. Only the shared instance
# opens all the configured interfaces directly, and other
# local programs communicate with the shared instance over
# a local socket. This is completely transparent to the
# user, and should generally be turned on. This directive
# is optional and can be removed for brevity.

# It is possible to allow remote management of Reticulum
# systems using the various built-in utilities, such as
# rnstatus and rnpath. You will need to specify one or
# more Reticulum Identity hashes for authenticating the
# queries from client programs. For this purpose, you can
# use existing identity files, or generate new ones with
# the rnid utility.

# You can configure Reticulum to panic and forcibly close
# if an unrecoverable interface error occurs, such as the
# hardware device for an interface disappearing. This is
# an optional directive, and can be left out for brevity.
# This behaviour is disabled by default.

# When Transport is enabled, it is possible to allow the
# Transport Instance to respond to probe requests from
# the rnprobe utility. This can be a useful tool to test
# connectivity. When this option is enabled, the probe
# destination will be generated from the Identity of the
# Transport Instance, and printed to the log at startup.
# Optional, and disabled by default.

[logging]
# Valid log levels are 0 through 7:
#   0: Log only critical information
#   1: Log errors and lower log levels
#   2: Log warnings and lower log levels
#   3: Log notices and lower log levels
#   4: Log info and lower (this is the default)
#   5: Verbose logging
#   6: Debug logging
#   7: Extreme logging

# The interfaces section defines the physical and virtual
# interfaces Reticulum will use to communicate on. This
# section will contain examples for a variety of interface
# types. You can modify these or use them as a basis for
# your own config, or simply remove the unused ones.
